# Get Started with Flow AI

Get up and running with Flow AI in **under 5 minutes**. Create expert-validated test datasets for your AI agents with our simple SDK.

## 1. Create Your Account

Sign up for Flow AI and access your dashboard:

1. Go to [flow-ai.com/app](https://flow-ai.com/app)
2. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
3. Complete the onboarding to create your first project

## 2. Get Your API Key

Once logged in, grab your API key from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Click **Generate New Key**
3. Copy your API key (starts with `flow_...`)

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

## 3. Install the SDK

Install the Flow AI SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install flowai_sdk
```

## 4. Connect and Authenticate

Create your first connection to Flow AI:

```python
import os
from flowai_sdk import FlowAI

# Set your API key
os.environ["FLOW_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"

# Initialize the client
client = FlowAI(server_url="https://api.flow-ai.com")

# Test your connection
try:
    # Login and get session token
    login_response = client.authentication.sdk_login(
        http_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['FLOW_API_KEY']}"}
    )
    print("‚úÖ Connected successfully!")
    print(f"Session token: {login_response.jwt[:20]}...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Connection failed: {e}")
```

## 5. Create Your First Test Dataset

Upload sample data and create stages for expert validation:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Example: Upload agent rules for validation
file_path = "agent_rules.yaml"  # Your test data file
project_id = "your_project_id"  # From your dashboard

# Create a stage for expert validation
stages = client.stages.create(
    files=[file_path],
    source_type="AGENT_RULES",
    project_id=project_id,
    http_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {login_response.jwt}"}
)

print(f"‚úÖ Created {len(stages)} stage(s) for validation")

# Trigger the pipeline
job = client.jobs.trigger_pipeline(
    project_id=project_id,
    body=stages,
    http_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {login_response.jwt}"}
)

print(f"üöÄ Job started: {job.job_id}")
```

<Note>
Your test data is now queued for expert validation! Check your dashboard to see the progress and results.
