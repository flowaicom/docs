## 3. Install the SDK

```bash
pip install flowai_sdk
```

## 4. Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
FLOWAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 5. Connect and Create Project

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from flowai_sdk import FlowAI

load_dotenv()

client = FlowAI()

# Login to get session token
login_response = client.authentication.sdk_login(
    http_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('FLOWAI_API_KEY')}"}
)

auth_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {login_response.jwt}"}

# Create your first project
project = client.projects.create(
    name="My First Project",
    description="Getting started with Flow AI",
    http_headers=auth_headers
)

project_id = project.id
print(f"✅ Connected and created project: {project_id}")
```

## 6. Create Your First Test Dataset

```python
# Upload your test data files
stages = client.stages.create_from_files(
    file_paths=["agent_rules.yaml"],
    source_type="AGENT_RULES", 
    project_id=project_id,
    http_headers=auth_headers
)

# Generate test cases and batch
job_response = client.jobs.trigger_pipeline_from_stages(
    project_id=project_id,
    stages=stages,
    http_headers=auth_headers
)

print(f"🚀 Job started: {job_response.job_id}")
```

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**
- **API key errors**: Make sure your key starts with `flowai_` and is in your `.env` file
- **File not found**: Check that your data files exist in the correct path
