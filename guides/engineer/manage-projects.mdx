# How to: Manage Projects

This guide shows how to manage projects in FlowAI using the SDK. Ensure you are authenticated as shown in the [Authentication and Manage Your Information guide](./sdk-authentication.mdx).

## Prerequisites

-   FlowAI SDK installed.
-   Authenticated `client` and `auth_headers` (obtained via SDK login).
-   Import project models for creating and updating projects:
    ```python
    from flowai_sdk.models import ProjectCreate, ProjectUpdate
    ```

## Create a Project

To create a new project, you will use a `ProjectCreate` model that specifies the project's `name` and an optional `description`. The `userId` is automatically associated with your authenticated user.

```python
new_project_data = ProjectCreate(
    name="My New SDK Project",
    description="This project was created for SDK demonstration."
)

created_project = client.projects.create(
    request_body=new_project_data, 
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

The `created_project` is a `ProjectResponse` object containing details like `id`, `name`, `description`, `user_id`, `is_active`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. You can access the project ID with `created_project.id`.

## List Projects

Retrieve a list of your projects. The API supports pagination (`limit`, `offset`) and filtering by `status` (e.g., 'active', 'all', 'archived'). The response is a `ProjectListResponse` object.

```python
project_list_response = client.projects.list(http_headers=auth_headers)
```

For custom pagination or to include all projects:

```python
project_list_response = client.projects.list(
    status="all", 
    limit=20, 
    offset=0, 
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

Access the list of projects and pagination details with `project_list_response.projects` and `project_list_response.pagination`.

## Get a Specific Project

Fetch details for a single project using its `project_id`. The response is a `ProjectResponse` object.

```python
project_id_to_get = "your_project_id_here"

project_details = client.projects.get(
    project_id=project_id_to_get, 
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

Replace `"your_project_id_here"` with an actual Project ID.

## Update a Project

Modify the `name` or `description` of an existing project using a `ProjectUpdate` model. This corresponds to a `PATCH` request, so only fields you want to change need to be included in the model.

```python
project_id_to_update = "your_project_id_here"

update_payload = ProjectUpdate(
    name="My Project - Updated Name",
    description="This project description has been updated via SDK."
)

updated_project_details = client.projects.update(
    project_id=project_id_to_update,
    request_body=update_payload,
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

To update only the description:

```python
update_payload_desc_only = ProjectUpdate(description="New description only.")

updated_project_details = client.projects.update(
    project_id=project_id_to_update,
    request_body=update_payload_desc_only,
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

The `updated_project_details` is a `ProjectResponse` object with the modified project details.

## Archive a Project

Archive a project to mark it as inactive (`is_active: false`). This is a soft delete. The response is a `ProjectArchiveResponse` object.

```python
project_id_to_archive = "your_project_id_here"

archive_response = client.projects.archive(
    project_id=project_id_to_archive, 
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

The `archive_response` contains the `id` and the new `is_active` status (false).

## Delete a Project

Permanently delete a project. The API requires the project to be archived first. This action is irreversible.

```python
project_id_to_delete = "your_archived_project_id_here"

client.projects.delete(
    project_id=project_id_to_delete, 
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```

Replace `"your_archived_project_id_here"` with the actual ID of an archived project. A successful deletion usually returns no content from the API (HTTP 204 status).
