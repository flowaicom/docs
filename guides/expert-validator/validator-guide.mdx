## Validation Interface

*[Screenshot placeholder: Main validation interface]*

The interface shows:
- **Progress tracker** (e.g., "1 of 5", completion percentage)
- **Test case conversation** between user and AI
- **Tool calls** showing AI actions (like `search_flights`)
- **Validation panel** for your feedback

## How to Validate

### Review Process

1. **Read the conversation**: User request → AI response → Tool usage
2. **Evaluate the AI's performance**: Was it helpful and accurate?
3. **Make your decision**: Accept ✓ or Reject ✗
4. **Provide feedback**: Explain your reasoning

### When to Accept ✓
- AI understood the request correctly
- Response is accurate and helpful
- Tools were used appropriately

### When to Reject ✗
- AI misunderstood the request
- Response contains errors
- Wrong tools used or missing important information

### Adding Feedback

**Item-Specific Feedback** (Optional)
- Click on any message or tool call to add specific comments
- Use for detailed issues with particular parts

*[Screenshot placeholder: Item feedback modal]*

**Overall Feedback** (Required for rejections)
- Explain why you accepted or rejected
- Be specific: "The AI didn't consider the budget constraint" vs "This is wrong"
