# How to: Authenticate and Manage Your User Information

This guide shows you how to connect to the FlowAI API using your API key and manage your user account details.

## Prerequisites

-   You have a FlowAI account and a valid API key.
-   The FlowAI SDK is installed: `pip install flowai-sdk`
-   (Optional) `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables: `pip install python-dotenv`

## Authentication Flow Overview

Authenticating with the FlowAI API involves two main steps:
1.  **Login with API Key**: You exchange your long-lived `FLOWAI_API_KEY` for a temporary **session JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
2.  **Use Session Token**: This session JWT is then used to authenticate all subsequent API calls for the duration of the session.

## Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

It's best practice to store your API key as an environment variable.

Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory:

```bash title=".env"
FLOWAI_API_KEY="flow_your_actual_api_key_here"
```

## Step 2: Initialize Client and Log In

Load your environment variables, initialize the SDK client, and use your API key to log in. This process exchanges your API key for a session JWT, which is then used to authorize subsequent requests.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from flowai_sdk import FlowAI

load_dotenv()

api_key = os.getenv("FLOWAI_API_KEY")

if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("FLOWAI_API_KEY not found in environment variables.")

client = FlowAI()

login_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}

login_response = client.authentication.sdk_login(http_headers=login_headers)
session_jwt = login_response.jwt

auth_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {session_jwt}"}
```
After these steps, `auth_headers` can be used for all protected API calls.

## Step 3: Manage Your User Information

Once authenticated, you can retrieve and update your user profile.

### Get Your User Information

Fetch your current user profile details using the `auth_headers` obtained from the login step.
The `user` object will contain your profile information like ID, name, username, and role.

```python
# Assuming client and auth_headers are defined from the previous step
user = client.users.get_me(http_headers=auth_headers)
```

### Update Your Profile

Update your first name, last name, or username. The `updated_user_info` object will contain the new state of your user profile after the update.

```python
from flowai_sdk.models import UserUpdate

# Assuming client and auth_headers are defined
updated_user_info = client.users.update_me(
    request_body=UserUpdate(
        first_name="Jane",
        last_name="Doe",
        username="janedoe_updated"
    ),
    http_headers=auth_headers
)
```
Only provide the fields you want to change in the `UserUpdate` model. Unspecified fields will remain unchanged.


## Summary of Authentication Headers

-   **For `sdk_login`**: Use `{"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}"}`.
-   **For all other authenticated calls**: Use `{"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_SESSION_JWT}"}`.
